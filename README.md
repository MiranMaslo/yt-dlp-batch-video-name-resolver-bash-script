# yt-dlp-batch-video-name-resolver-bash-script
A Bash script that will allow you to resolve a list of *video URLs* or *video IDs* you give it into *video URL/video tittle pairs*.

Please donâ€™t forget to modify the script parameter *$ytdlp* to the appropriate path to _yt-dlp_ on your system!
The _which_ and _find_ commands might be helpful to you with this.

Then outputs is the video tittle (as in _yt-dlp -se_), then a newline and the video URL it resolved to *stdout*.
